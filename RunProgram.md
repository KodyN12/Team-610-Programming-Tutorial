# Running a Robot Program

Running a robot program is very similar to running a normal program in VSCode, albeit with a few extra things to make sure of.
<br>

The very first thing you need to do is [connect to the robot](Connecting.md). Once you have done this, make sure your robot has code to run. You can check this via the FRC Driver Station app. If you do not have code on your robot, you should download your code. Either press `F5` while connected to the robot or the chord `Cmd+Shift+P` and select `WPILib: Deploy Robot Code`

Once your robot has code, you can enable it in different modes using the FRC Driver Station app.
