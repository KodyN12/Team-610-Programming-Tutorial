<h2>First Robotics Competiiton Team 610 Programming Tutorial</h2>

Hi!<br>
Welcome to Team 610's programming tutorial. Of course, there are plenty of other resources on the internet (feel free to use them as well), but this is being created with the specific idea of giving you a general sense of how we here at 610 do things. For any extra help, I would recommend first checking out the [WPILib Documentation](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/index.html) before exploring the rest of the web.<br>
Heads up, this will be Java oriented as that is what we use.<br>
Things should be in sequential order of where to start and end, but jump to whatever you think is interesting or need help with. For any grade 9's and 10's, try to do this in order up until you reach the more specific sections on how to do things like spin a motor.<br>
With that being said, grab your rubber duck, settle down somewhere comfy, and lets get right into it!
