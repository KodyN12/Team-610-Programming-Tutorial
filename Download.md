# How to Download WPILib's Tools

For all FRC Programming and Software things, you will be using WPILib's collection of tools. Of course, you will need to download these.<br>

<b>An important thing to note is that this gets updated throughout the year, so you will need to update your own version. To do this, just follow this tutorial again!</b><br>

The latest release of WPILib's tools can be found at this [link](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/releases)<br>

Navigate to this and download the latest version for your operating system. Once it has downloaded, navigate to where it is located in your File Explorer/Finder, and run the WPILibInstaller.exe
<br>

Follow the popups it shows you and select the relevant choices for yourself. It is recommended that you choose to "Download VSCode for Single Install" and install it "For this User"
<br>

Once this has finished, open up the FRC VSCode that just finished downloading, and we can start programming. It will be titled [Current Year] WPILib VSCode
