# Connecting to a robot

You are able to connect to your robot in a few different ways. The most common way is to connect via radio, as this gives you the most mobility with your robot while testing stuff. To do this, make sure you have programmed your radio by following [this tutorial](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-3/radio-programming.html). Then, all you have to do is connect to it like you would a Wifi network.

A second way to connect to your robot is via ethernet. On 610, we install a switch that gives us access to another ethernet port for us to connect to our robot. Alternatively, you could connect using the ethernet plugged into the radio. Simply plug this into your computer and wait to get comms.

A final way to connect to your robot is directly to your RoboRio. This is not recommended as often your Rio is tucked away behind other parts of your robot, inhibiting your movement. However, if you need to perform a systems check pre-match or quickly download code to the robot, this is a great method as you will get connection quite quickly compared to the other methods. On your Rio, there is a USB Type B port. Connect directly to this, and your set.
